##  Running JSON Server

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can check the installed Node.js version by running the `node -v` command in the terminal.
2. In the root directory of your project, verify that the `db.json` file exists and is populated with the desired data.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.
4. Execute the following command to start the JSON Server and make it watch the `db.json` file:

```
shellCopy code
json-server --watch db.json
```

1. The JSON Server will start and be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Now you can make HTTP requests to the fake REST API using the routes defined in the `db.json` file. For example, to get all videos, make a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/videos`.

Make sure to keep the terminal open while using the JSON Server. It will provide information about incoming requests and other useful messages.

I hope this helps you run the JSON Server and use the existing `db.json` file in this project!
